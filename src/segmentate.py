        overlap_percent (int): percentage of overlap from previous window [0, 100]
    Example window length 4s and 50% overlap:
    
    1. original time series (each number represents a second): |1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13|
    
    2. use function: segmentate(|1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13|, 4, 50)
    3. returns: [|1,2,3,4|,|3,4,5,6|,|5,6,7,8|,|7,8,9,10|,|9,10,11,12|]
    Remark: last window (|11,12,13|) wouldn't have full length which is why this data is ignored
